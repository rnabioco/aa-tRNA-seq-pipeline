"""
and collapses the output of running a Remora CCA model and extracting
per-read information on charging likelihood into an ML tag into
per-isodecoder counts (and CPM-normalized counts) of charged and uncharged
tRNAs as determined by the model with a ML >= 200 threshold.

tRNA-AA-anticodon-family-species-chargingref are all preserved from BWA alignment,
and can be further collapsed as desired in downstream analysis

CPM normalization reflects counts per million reads that passed alingnment and
the filtering parameters for Remora classification; these are full length tRNA
